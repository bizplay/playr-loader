Playr loader
============

Introduction
------------
The files in this project enable starting up the Google Chrome browser using the playr_loader.html file
in order to show digital signage content in the browser.
The playr_loader.html file checks if playr.biz is available (an internet connection is present) and if so it loads
the requested digital signage channel. 

Files that can be used to start up a browser correctly are 
provided for Windows (StartChromeForPlayr.cmd) and Linux (StartChromeForPlayr.sh). 
A file is also provided to start up to three browsers to display up to three channels on
up to three screens (StartChromeOnMultipleScreens.cmd) on Windows.

You need to edit these files to set the intended channel(s) and possibly other settings. These files contain 
further instructions.
