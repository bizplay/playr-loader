Playr loader
============

Introduction
------------
The files in this project enable starting up the Google Chrome browser using the playr_loader.html file.
The html file checks if playr.biz is available (an internet connection is present) and if so it loads
the requested digital signage channel. 

Files that can be used to start up the browser correctly are 
provided for Windows (StartChromeForPlayr.cmd) and Linux (StartChromeForPlayr.sh). Edit these files
to set the intended channel. These files contain further instructions.
